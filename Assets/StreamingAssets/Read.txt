Hello! I'm glad to have you reading this!

Thank you for playing this little fan-game, I haven't expected anyone to play this, so you've made my day :)

I started making this because I heard 2.2 was coming out on October 2023, so I really wanted to pay respects to RobTop for the effort he's put into it, and also because I wanted to challenge myself.

And it's been fun, even if it was hard (especially the Discord RPC, that was the most challenging part of this, and it probably still doesn't work properly by the time you're reading this)
